This includes detailed analysis of wave-particle duality, spacetime curvature, multiversal theories, and the philosophical implications of quantum entanglement on free will and determinism. The discussion covers advanced mathematical concepts including tensor calculus, complex analysis, and topological field theory, with applications to cosmology, particle physics, and consciousness studies.",
